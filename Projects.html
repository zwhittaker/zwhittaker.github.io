  <h2> Embedded Systems Design Final Project</h2>

  <div style="width:60%;"> <h3>Background:</h3>Insulated faux brick (IFB) is an improvement on traditional faux brick that aims to further reduce weight and installation time while providing insulation characteristics beyond traditional brick. In preparation for growing demand, the company that manufactures IFB is seeking to increase throughput and scalability through automation. One area of difficulty, for which this company has sponsored this project, is the assembly of corner bricks. Current production of corner bricks relies on human workers to apply adhesive and press together two end pieces until the adhesive has dried. This goal of this project is to provide a device to increase throughput by reducing human interaction time with each individual assembly. Our working design is a collection of independent assemblies that each handle alignment, gluing, and holding, for a single brick. The size of the assembly is minimized to allow up to eight units to fit within the reach of a typical worker. Lastly the modular design can be scaled to meet the future needs of the company with minimal redesign and reduced need to train new employees.</div>
