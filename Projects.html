  <h2> Embedded Systems Design Final Project</h2>
  <hr/ align ="left" width ="60%">
  <div style="width:60%;"> <h3>Background:</h3>After an event like the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, the area around a powerplant can reach levels of radiation much too high for humans to navigate. Therefore, post-mortem inspection and cleanup of the area is most often handled by specialized robots. These robots are built to navigate the uneven remains of the powerplant and send back important data such as video, temperature, and radiation levels. Since human operators must stay out of areas of the highest radiation, the ability to control the robots over the web is key to maintaining operation.<br />
      <h3>Proposal:</h3> We propose to simulate this scenario using the DE1 SoC and a two wheeled robot instructional kit from Osoyoo seen below in figure 1. This robot contains a Raspberry Pi computer running a Debian Linux variant, two independently controlled wheels, a USB-enabled camera, and wireless features such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The Raspberry Pi also has 22 general purpose input-output (GPIO) pins which we will use to mount a temperature sensor. We will then modify the server code provided by Osoyoo to send the temperature data and motor outputs to the client (in this case, the DE1) for displaying and recording. For controlling the robot, we will create a touch-based GUI on the DE1 SoC display based on the concept seen below in figure 2.

      <br />
      If possible, we will create backend scripts on the DE1 to integrate the commanded motions and keep track of the robotâ€™s position and orientation. By doing so, this would enable us to add a location to each temperature measurement and create a heat-map of the room and identify any danger zones. We will also explore running inverse kinematic models on the FPGA for path following. Lastly, we will attempt to implement machine learning algorithms to improve the kinematic models and to predict the temperature at different locations in the room based on past data.

  <h2>Master's Thesis</h2>
  <hr/ align ="left" width ="60%">
  <div style="width:60%;"> <h3>Background:</h3>Insulated faux brick (IFB) is an improvement on traditional faux brick that aims to further reduce weight and installation time while providing insulation characteristics beyond traditional brick. In preparation for growing demand, the company that manufactures IFB is seeking to increase throughput and scalability through automation. One area of difficulty, for which this company has sponsored this project, is the assembly of corner bricks. Current production of corner bricks relies on human workers to apply adhesive and press together two end pieces until the adhesive has dried. This goal of this project is to provide a device to increase throughput by reducing human interaction time with each individual assembly. Our working design is a collection of independent assemblies that each handle alignment, gluing, and holding, for a single brick. The size of the assembly is minimized to allow up to eight units to fit within the reach of a typical worker. Lastly the modular design can be scaled to meet the future needs of the company with minimal redesign and reduced need to train new employees.</div>
